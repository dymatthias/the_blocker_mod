 d_highlands:0 "Highlands"
 d_highlands_desc:0 "Windy mountains and steep valleys criss-cross this region, with wide barrens stretching for miles across the highlands. The region is rich in various useful ores, but any large-scale development would require a terraforming project as daunting as the hills themselves."

 d_steppe_uplands:0 "Steppe Uplands"
 d_steppe_uplands_desc:0 "This region of rugged ills, ravines, and swamp is unsuitable for all but the hardiest colonists who dare to scrape out a living working in the fields and mines."

 d_fertile_delta:0 "Fertile Delta"
 d_fertile_delta_desc:0 "A major river delta covers this region like a many-fingered hand. Between the sand-spits and marshes are swathes of excellent farmland and the deep tidal estuaries could house tidal generator stations to fuel nearby cities."

 d_misty_plains:0 "Misty Plains"
 d_misty_plains_desc:0 "Humid and nearly always foggy, these damp plains are covered in deep bogs and peat moss punctuated by outcrops of rock and pine trees. Though verdant, the constant mist gives the region a gloomy, ghostly feel."
