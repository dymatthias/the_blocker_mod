 # The Blocker Mod - Custom Features - English
 
 d_fjordland:0 "Fjordland"
 d_fjordland_desc:0 "Sharp cliffs plunge straight into deep and misty bays, providing stunning vistas. The crinkly terrain is visible even from space but the ridges are impassavble, makes large-scale development impossible."

 d_mire:0 "Mire"
 d_mire_desc:0 "Wet soil, shrunken trees, and thick mosses choke this murky quagmire, which is home to all manner of alien flora, fauna, and especially insect life."

 d_highlands:0 "Highlands"
 d_highlands_desc:0 "Windy mountains and steep valleys criss-cross this region, with wide barrens stretching for miles across the highlands. The region is rich in various useful ores, but any large-scale development would require a terraforming project as daunting as the hills themselves."

 d_steppe_uplands:0 "Steppe Uplands"
 d_steppe_uplands_desc:0 "This region of rugged ills, ravines, and swamp is unsuitable for all but the hardiest colonists who dare to scrape out a living working in the fields and mines."

 d_taiga:0 "Taiga"
 d_taiga_desc:0 "Still as a tomb, these silent, snowy woodlands sweep across vast plains of [planet.GetName]'s sub-polar regions. As peaceful as they seem from orbit, the conifer forests hide murky bogs and miles of swampland."

 d_sandstone_spires:0 "Sandstone Spires"
 d_sandstone_spires_desc:0 "Towers of fragile stone teeter on the open plains of this world, harboring nooks, crannies, and caves carved by wind and who knows what else inside."

 d_gas_vents:0 "REPLACE_ME"
 d_gas_vents_desc:0 "REPLACE_ME"

 d_natural_gardens:0 "Natural Gardens"

 d_glacier_lake:0 "Glacier Lake"
 d_glacier_lake_desc:0 "At the foot of a large glacier, this crystal-clear lake provides a chilly but welcome oasis amongst the icy mountains."

 d_giant_tree:0 "Giant Tree"
 d_giant_tree_desc:0 "The canopy of a truly massive deciduous tree provides its own ecosystem in the shade beneath its gigantic leaves and its miles-long roots expose valuable mineral seams for easy extraction."

 d_great_lake:0 "Great Lake"
 d_great_lake_desc:0 "Initially mistaken for an inland sea from orbit, this vast freshwater lake offers rugged but valuable farmland at its shore."

 d_floodplains:0 "Floodplains"
 d_floodplains_desc:0 "Although ideal farmland, these wide and grassy plains flood after heavy rainfalls when nearby rivers and wetlands spill their banks."

 d_tidal_marshes:0 "Tidal Marshes"
 d_tidal_marshes_desc:0 "The smell of salt water pervades these flat, sandy grasslands. While the flooding is predictable based on tidal cycles, the ground is too loose to build foundations. They are, however, excellent locations for livestock grazing and hay farming."

 d_fertile_delta:0 "Fertile Delta"
 d_fertile_delta_desc:0 "A major river delta covers this region like a many-fingered hand. Between the sand-spits and marshes are swathes of excellent farmland and the deep tidal estuaries could house tidal generator stations to fuel nearby cities."

 d_basaltic_outcrops:0 "Basaltic Outcrops"
 d_basaltic_outcrops_desc:0 "Volcanic activity and a thin crust have caused the extrusion of large croppings of igneous rock. These minerals, usually much more difficult to access, are extremely valuable in alloy production."

 d_volcanic_island:0 "Volcanic Island"
 d_volcanic_island_desc:0 "Far off the coast, this mountainous island regularly spews forth ash from a simmering volcano at its peak."

 d_fish_shoals:0 "Fish Shoals"
 d_fish_shoals_desc:0 "After launching ocean survey vessels here, sailors immediately ran aground--not on rock, but on fish! The shoals are so thick that a child could catch supper here."

 d_scrubland:0 "Scrubland"
 d_scrubland_desc:0 "Not much grows in these dry wasteland regions, but pockets of moisture left in rock-pools and sand-beds allows some more resilient small trees to grow through the sandy soil. The region is remote but provides ample space for farming and small settlements for those who likewise thrive in these wide savannahs."

 d_barren:0 "Barren"
 d_barren_desc:0 "Bereft of any value, this land is too dry, rocky, and poor to farm. During rains, soil quickly vanishes and floods soon follow. Even birds avoid this place and trees can find no purchase on the slate, which is riddled with impurities that make it useless in our alloy forges. Extensive work is required here to remediate the soil and water table before life can flourish here."
 tooltip_clear_barren:0 "Remediating the soil in this £blocker£Barren will take time, but lead to the creation of a more useful§S Feature§T when our terraformation specialists are done."

 d_drylands:0 "Drylands"
 d_drylands_desc:0 "Parched and dusty, these rough lowlands stretch across whole regions and make for poor farmland. However, easy accessibility and a relatively stable climate make them ideal for solar farms and larger surface mining operations."

 d_crags:0 "Crags"
 d_crags_desc:0 "Much of this region is covered in short, sharp ridges and rocky outcrops hide treacherous cliffs behind their sward grasses and wildflowers. Seabirds flock overhead and salt spray washes across the exposed land from passing seas and storms."

 d_dunelands:0 "Dunelands"
 d_dunelands_desc:0 "Rolling dunes cover every conceivable surface of this region in fine-grained sand that fouls any machinery it comes into contact with. Wind and solar farms can be built here, but crops grown anywhere nearby wither as soon as the wind picks up."

 d_highland_lake:0 "Highland Lake"
 d_highland_lake_desc:0 "Tucked between grassy hills and shale mountains, this lake provides a sheltered region to grow sturdier crops. If the lakebed were drained and filled, it might be possible to build a small city here."

 d_lakelands:0 "Lakelands"
 d_lakelands_desc:0 "Spread across this steep region are innumerable small lakes and tarns. The steep shores and exposed crags leave little room to build, but herd animals can range freely here with farmers living in picturesque villages nearby."

 d_lowland_hills:0 "Lowland Hills"
 d_lowland_hills_desc:0 "Rolling hills and enclosed valleys cover much of this region. Though too swampy to be considered for larger building projects, these lowlands make ideal grazing land and abundant and accessible coal and iron might make for lucrative local mining."

 d_misty_plains:0 "Misty Plains"
 d_misty_plains_desc:0 "Humid and nearly always foggy, these damp plains are covered in deep bogs and peat moss punctuated by outcrops of rock and pine trees. Though verdant, the constant mist gives the region a gloomy, ghostly feel."

 d_salt_flats:0 "Salt Flats"
 d_salt_flats_desc:0 "This wide plain likely used to be a sea-bed and exposed salt glitters white and red in the parching sunlight from [planet.system.GetName] while sulfur and phosphorus waft through the air."

 d_arid_plains:0 "Arid Plains"
 d_arid_plains_desc:0 "Dry and riddled with rock, these rugged plains make construction and maintenance difficult. A lack of neaby fresh water makes the region a low priority for settlement, but leaves ample space for large-scale energy facilities."

 d_sandsea:0 "Sandsea"
 d_sandsea_desc:0 "A curious phenomenon, salt water and loose sand from nearby desert regions have mixed to form a roiling sea of quicksand and sand foam that flows with [planet.GetName]'s tides."

 d_sandstone_cliffs:0 "Sandstone Cliffs"
 d_sandstone_cliffs_desc:0 "Towers cliffs loom over this region. The crumbling sandstone is too fragile to support any larger foundation but allows miners easy access to useful minerals."

 d_rough_plains:0 "Roough Plainsland"
 d_rough_plains_desc:0 "There is nothing especially remarkable about this region, but its combination of razor-sharp rock, swift-flowing rivers, and unsavory weather leave it low on just about every ranking of potential settlements."

 ### The Blocker Mod - Artificial Features - English

 d_rubble:0 "Rubble"

But, slowly, sand becomes glass and glass becomes silicon; beams hold buildings above the dunes and fibers send plans, designs, and ideas back and forth at whirlwind speed."
