It is rarely enough, and there are constant rumors of reserves running low."

 d_survival_camps:0 "Survival Camps"
 d_survival_camps_desc:0 "Those not fortunate enough to be able to reach a shelter mostly congregated in meager camps in whatever hospitable regions they could find.

 d_homeworld_black_market:0 "Black Market"
 d_homeworld_black_market_desc:0 "What little government remained after society's collapse was quickly forced to deal with the crime lords and brokers running black markets in various refugee camps and ruined cities across the world.
