 ### Reactor Events (boom!)

 # 311. Fusion Reactor Goes Critical
 tbm.311_name:0 "§Y[planet.GetName]§!: Fusion Reactor Goes Critical"
 tbm.311_desc:0 "In the middle of the night on [planet.GetName], alarms at the §Y[reactor.GetName]§! were quickly followed by a scrambled attempt to evacuate first the facility and then the area  surrounding the soon-to-be-inevitable blast site.\n\nBefore anyone could escape, the reactor housing was breached and immolated the entire city in the light of several suns before extinguishing itself but a few milliseconds later.\n\nThe damage is extensive. The immediate region has been levelled, and millions are dead. Soon, surveyors and search parties equipped with radiation suits will be able to catalogue the full extent and begin repairs."

 # 312. Cold Fusion Leak
 tbm.312_name:0 "§Y[planet.GetName]§!: Cold Fusion Leak"
 tbm.312_desc:0 "The vast §Y[reactor.GetName]§! of [planet.GetName[, previously thought impregnable, have turned out not to be. Nobody is quite sure how long radioactive waste has been leaking into the surrounding watershed, but it seems to have been happening for a while.\n\nThe breach has become so large that it can no longer be safely contained, leaving the surrounding region uninhabitable for at least a generation as previously gentle rivers and lakes boil away in a plume of superheated effluent.\n\nNeedless to say, the reactor itself is gone. Soon, safety inspectors will make a ruling on exactly how far downstream the damage extends. Nobody is expecting good news."

 # 313. Antimatter Core Breach
 tbm.313_name:0 "§Y[planet.GetName]§!: Antimatter Core Breach"
 tbm.313_desc:0 "For years, our colonies have been powered by quiet, safe antimatter power, with the inherently unstable reacion secreted away behind several feet of plasteel and insulating fields. A breach was a purely theoretical occurrence used mostly to frighten first-year physics students with the specter of especially onerous safety protocols.\n\nAfter all, the sheer scale of destruction involved in an antimatter explosion doesn't bear a practical approach. Now, however, several continents have been practically eradicated by the mere shockwaves of the explosion at the §Y[reactor.GetName]§!. Moreover, the blast has sent unstable antimatter into low orbit, and pilots as far out as the system's hyperlane entry are complaining about dangerous readings. Neither can any ship get close enough to contain these rogue particles, and thanks to the inherent efficiency of antimatter, it may be decades before the reactions burn out and weeks before the aftershocks subside and more practical safety protocols developed."

 tbm.314_desc:0 "Although it may be years before [owner.GetScientistPlural] understand the full extent of the damage caused to subspace by the antimatter explosion, such questions are at last academic, and vessels can once again safely traverse the system without delays or detours.\n\nThe [owner.GetName] has been dealt a significant reminder about the dangers of the technology that makes fast space travel possible."
