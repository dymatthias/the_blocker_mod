 tbm_handler.101.desc:0 "The colonists who landed on [planet.GetName] have been greeted with a strange and  wonderful alien landscape. Though the new world offers much bounty, even more work lies ahead to prepare land for the cities and industry that will one day make [planet.GetName] a crucial part of the [planet.GetOwnerName].\n\nFortunately, our colonists were hand-picked for their hardiness, ingenuity, and courage in the face of the challenge ahead. They have spent the past months on-world setting up camps, charting the [olanet.GetPlanetMoon] geography, and documenting alien life in detail.\n\nAll that remains is to allocate resources and equipment to begin clearing land to make [planet.GetName] into a new home."

 tbm.3.name:0 "A Famous Mountain"
 tbm.3.desc:0 "A number of colonists exploring [planet.GetName] have discovered a resplendent mountain in a distant range. Its peak dwarfs anything else on the planet and even challenges the most storied mountains on our homeworld for immensity and majesty.\n\nWhen the [SunType] [SunsetDependentPlural], it looks truly resplendent.The expedition's lead has petitioned [owner.GetLeaderName] for permission to name it after [colonist_name.GetHerHis] [ColonistSpecialFriend] back on [owner.capital_scope.GetName]. Our [ColonialAffairs] office refers to the mountain as 3X21-Southwest, but the topographical corps acknowledges this isn't a very good name and a better one might bring more attention to the colonization effort."

The mountain, however, has become a symbol of pride among new settlers, who are opposed to excavations. The former expedition lead, meanwhile, is now a local politician and has claimed the mineral veins belong to [owner.colonist_name.GetHisHer]."

Recreation and resident groups are already up in arms, complaining that this development will ruin the scenery and destroy the ecologically sensitive coastline.\n\nThe oligarch has considerable clout in the [planet.GetName] colonial government, and has apparently already purchased several skiffs, yachts, and sailboats. If the marina isn't approved, it could lead to a loss of investment for the new colony."
 tbm.22.desc_treehuggers:0 "A local politician has applied for permits to build a large private marina on the§Y Teeming Reef§! off the coast of our new city on [planet.GetName]. According to frantic fundraising missives from opposition groups, this application is likely to succeed in spite of environmental regulations, and scientists are worried about the marina's impact on the coastal ecosystem.\n\nA mass protest is planned for early next week and law-enforcement officials are concerned the [planet.GetPlanetMoon]'s spaceport could be shut down. Worse still, the politician has threatened to scuttle significant investment on the [planet.GetPlanetMoon] if the marina deal falls through."

 tbm.51.desc:0 "Early scans of [planet.GetName]'s oceans revealed several large regions densely populated by an especially toxic species of kelp. Unfortunately, these have proven to be a much more significant obstacle to marine exploration than anticipated, and several colonists have taken severely ill or died after coming into even the briefest contact with the §Y£blocker£Toxic Kelp§!.\n\nLocal harbormasters have even tried issuing a brightly-colored safety video featuring Puffy the Plankton, but casualties are still coming in."

The brother of one of the scientists is the junior employee of the month at a large breakfast cereal company on [owner.capital_scope.GetName] and has attempted to file patents on a kelp-based formula. The paperwork alerted intelligence operatives monitoring for biohazard threats who tipped off the fleet admiralty, which now wants to apply the toxins to bio-weapons.\n\nMost of the kelp has already been incinerated, along with several scientists who got too close. Unfortunately, there's only enough left for one shipment."
