 tbm_hw.11:0 "Food Rations Running Low"
 tbm_hw.11_desc:0 "Years ago, our forebears on §Y[planet.GetName]§!, fearing the worst, prepared massive £blocker£ §YFood Rations§! in the mine-shafts and shelter, and since the fall of [owner.GetAdj] civilization, these have sustained our population, assuring the continuation of our kind.\n\nOf late, lines outside rationing stations have been getting longer and some locations have reported running out of crucial protein and carbohydrate staples.\n\nMore worryingly, rumours of worse shortages are spreading, creating disquiet in the camps and altercations outside ration stores as hungry citizens jostle for what unspoilt food remains.\n\nThe food stored in the shelters will soon run out unless something is done. It will be years before the planet's ecosystem recovers enough to allow for reconstructive farming. Now may be the time to consider more desperate plans."
 tbm_hw.11_gestalt_desc:0 "Since the cataclysm, food has been scarce. Thousands of drones are malnourished and inefficient, and many die each week. Now, the few nutrient stockpiles that survived the immediate aftermath are running low, and drone compliance has been falling rapidly.\n\nIt will be years before the planet's ecosystem recovers enough to allow for reconstructive farming. Further options may be necessary, and soon."

 tbm_hw.13_tooltip:0 "The situation on §Y[target.GetName]§! has worsened, and after months of strict food rations, a routine night-time disturbance sparked larger riots that quickly spread through the camps and overwhelmed local security forces. Criminals have exploited the disorder to wrest control and extort what little food remains for themselves."

 tbm_hw.14:0 "Malnutrition"
 tbm_hw.14_desc_corp:0 "The rapidly declining food supplies on §Y[target.GetName]§! has led to several outbreaks of disease and a sharp drop in health and performance metrics across most shelters and settlements. Without access to food, no one wants to work. Several subsidiary offices have attempted to increase wages and one restaurant chain even declare independence from its parent company, but even these off-shoots can't solve the core obstacle. Middle managers are withering and those front-line employees still alive can barely function, let alone take advantage of the corporate family benefits program. Unless something is done, corporate retention rates are likely to plummet."
 tbm_hw.14_desc:0 "The rapidly declining food supplies on §Y[target.GetName]§! have led to several outbreaks of disease and a sharp drop in life expectancy worldwide. Lines outside ration centers only get longer and workers only get thinner. Without enough food, the sound of [owner.GetSpeciesSpawnNamePlural]' cries fill the air as those still able scavenge for any scrap of edible food.\n\nWithout intervention, our already-dwindling population is likely to collapse.""
 tbm_hw.14_desc_hive:0 "Without enough food to sustain basic biological processes, swathes of drones across §Y[target.GetName]§! are reporting starvation status in sharp, distressed cries of pain.

 tbm_hw.14_tooltip:0 "Without a change in approach, the lack of food will result in a severe penalty to £mod_pop_growth_speed£ biological §YPop Growth§! as the existing £pops£ §CPops§! are unable to consume enough $food$ to survive."

 tbm_hw.15_name:0 "Privately Sponsored Colony"
 tbm_hw.15:0 "Private commercial interests on §Y[target.GetName]§!, hoping to eat, have sponsored their own off-world ranch on one of our colonies. The good news is that these new farms could potentially send food shipments back to the homeworld; the bad news is these new parcels exist outside local colonial authority and the money behind them is shadowy at best. But with starvation spreading on §Y[target.GetName]§!, some have even begun questioning whether these private interests might do a better job than the current government."
 tbm_hw.15_option:0 "At least it's some relief."
 tbm_hw.15_tooltip:0 "A £blocker£ §YPrivate Farming Colony§! will be added to one of your colonies. Although this will take up space and cause some unrest, it will also allow for more $district_farming_plural$, and additional alternatives may present themselves if the situation does worsen."

Hungry and unable to decide what to do with the kidnapped governor, the small group of kidnappers resorted to eating [target.leader.GetHerHim] instead, figuring it would serve as a message to the rest of the establishment getting fat off the backs of the people and... the screed goes on.\n\nSecurity forces have vowed to better protect whomever is next appointed as governor."
 tbm_hw.16_governor:0 "At least they got a decent meal out of it."

 tbm_hw.18_name:0 "Colonial Bounty"

The camps and warrens throb with collective unity and a sense of something near to... hope passes through the organism's fibers at the prospect of one day restoring our world to its prime."
 tbm_hw.18_desc:0 "Regular food shipments from [colonial_bounty.GetName] have eased the mood on §Y[target.GetName]§!. Feasts and festivals have galvanized the sick and distraught in the camps, fostering new hope among those who have survived this world's cataclysmic past to realize new wealth among the stars.\n\nAt the same time, the situation on §Y[colonial_bounty.GetName]§! is not quite so rosy. Fieldworkers and farmers grumble about taxes and food tithes, having already sacrificed to colonize brand new world. While the odd protest is well within the purview of local colonial officials, food stores on [target.GetName] now have enough food to stave off any further unrest. It may be possible to ease some of the burden on our colonists."

 tbm_hw.19_desc:0 "Without food, all things perish. Dead and deviant drones litter the warrens and workplaces of §Y[target.GetName]§!. Little now remains even to repurpose their biomass into protein for the central organism. In the end, life is a closed system.\n\nThe cataclysm we have inflicted on ourselves has revealed much about the nature of life, its fragility, and -- perhaps -- its possibility.\n\nWithout energy, consciousness wanes. The hive grows quiet. But it survives. Barely. Perhaps there is another way. A better way. Already, those drones that survive are fending alone. Foraging. Working for something more than... unity. Fighting for themselves, and their own survival, as individuals.\n\nWhat are we to become?"
 tbm_hw.19_autocannibalism:0 "We must survive."
 tbm_hw.19_autocannibalism_tooltip:0 "We will break down the Organism itself to survive, repurposing critical hive §YNodes§! for materials and food."

 tbm_hw.19_machine_tooltip:0 "Much of the hive already relies on electronic computer networks to function. These "machines" do not need $food$, and yet they send impulses and react to stimuli much as we do.

It's dangerous work for those brave enough to risk life and limb out on the radioactive wastes.\n\nNow, after a romantic falling-out between two rival clan-members, the leaders of each band have announced lucrative prices -- on each other. Their always-heavily-armed underlings are going at it with great gusto, seeking recognition and renown among the squalid remains of [owner.GetAdj] society.\n\nIt's unclear if there's any real possibility of a lull in the fighting. For now, it's been mostly confined to the bleaker camps but the betting markets are making a windfall and security forces are worried about a total loss of control if clashes escalate."

Although the spate of public and violent executions haseen unsettling for many, the surviving £blocker£ §YScavenger Band§! has promised local administrators it will keep the peace and, more importantly, maintain mineral quotas.\n\nHowever, there have been noticeable grumbles from parts merchants and their local miners about extortionate \"dues\" charged by the surviving band for participation in its dubiously-regulated market."

 tbm_hw.24_desc:0 "After months of intense fighting between §S[planet.GetName]'s rival £blocker£§CScavenger Bands§!, a tense stand-off between each gang's leaders broke unlikely ground. It seems all involved harbor a certain disdain for centralized authority and, particularly, the excessive inspections by [owner.GetAdj] security forces.\n\nThe ensuing unified assault took us by surprise, disabling critical command posts and spiralled out of control from there. Frenzied and fallout-ridden fighters scrambled through the capital in search of launch codes, valuable alloys, and any scrap they could sell. The only upside is that both scavenger leaders have been killed during the engagement, and under threat of military retaliation, their underlings have agreed to a peace deal that should, in time, see a modicum of normalcy return to §Y[planet.GetName]§! and its mineral markets."

It seems [leader.GetSheHe] has been secretly running the £blocker£ §YScavenger Band§!d for some time now. Before communications could be re-established with operatives in the field, the assassination was carried out and [leader.GetName] successfully terminated.\n\nThe embarrassment humbled the surviving £blocker£ §YScavenger Band§! enough to stop the fighting and its leaders are sufficiently grateful to agree to disarmanent and increased oversight.
