# TBM - AI Planet Designation Archetypes

# Basic planet designation weighting applied to (almost) every feature.
# General idea is we want rural, research, and unity planets to keep more bonuses; industrial and urban worlds, less so.
# Specialized resource districts (i.e., farming) are handled in each feature to avoid over-generalization.
# Not called on most negative features as the logic is inverse; these are handled in deposits/.
# This also contains the vanilla Environmentalist modifier until I decide how to change it.

# Habilitability - do we like planet-appropriate features? (This will help with terraforming down the line)
