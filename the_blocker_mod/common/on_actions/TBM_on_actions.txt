### The Blocker Mod - on_actions

#	Most TBM events fire on_colony_yearly_pulse, as it's in planet_scope and doesn't check that many vanilla events.
#	This also helps avoid too many things happening on January 1st.


### Main Feature Events
#	Note: events only get registered here after being tested!

on_colony_yearly_oulse = {

}


### Handler Events

on_colonized = {
	events = {
		tbm_handler.100
	}
}
