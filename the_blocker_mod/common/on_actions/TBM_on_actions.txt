### The Blocker Mod - on_actions

#	Most TBM events fire on_colony_yearly_pulse, as it's in planet_scope and doesn't check that many vanilla events.
#	This also helps avoid too many things happening on January 1st.
#	Most TBM events have handlers that handle randomness and/or add more more limited triggers.

### Init Events
on_press_begin = {
	events = {
		tbm_handler.102 # Add Wild World to planets that need it
	}
}



### Main Feature Events

on_colonized = {
	events = {
		tbm_handler.100	# Pioneering Colonists
	}
}

on_colony_yearly_oulse = {
	events = {
		#tbm.101	# A Shiny Rock
		tbm.51 # Toxic Kelp
		tbm.52 # Kelp Insights
