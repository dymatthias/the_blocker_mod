### The Blocker Mod - on_actions

#	Most TBM events fire on_colony_yearly_pulse, as it's in planet_scope and doesn't check that many vanilla events.
#	This also helps avoid too many things happening on January 1st.
#	Most TBM events have handlers that handle randomness and/or add more more limited triggers.

### Initialization Handlers

	events = {
		tbm_handler.2	# Fixes features for Advanced Start empires
