### The Blocker Mod - on_actions

#	Most TBM events fire on_colony_yearly_pulse, as it's in planet_scope and doesn't check that many vanilla events.
#	This also helps avoid too many things happening on January 1st.
#	Most TBM events have handlers that handle randomness and/or add more more limited triggers.


### Main Feature Events
#	Note: events only get registered here after being tested!

on_colony_yearly_oulse = {
	events = {
		tbm.31	# A City of the Desert
		tbm.101	# A Shiny Rock
		tbm.51 # Toxic Kelp
		tbm.52 # Kelp Insights
	}
}


### Handler Events

on_colonized = {
	events = {
		tbm_handler.100	# Pioneering Colonists
	}
}

on_district_complete = {
	random_events = {
		50 = 0
		50 = tbm.21 # Proposed Marina (must 
	}
}
