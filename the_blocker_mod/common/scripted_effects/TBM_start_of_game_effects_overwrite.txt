### The Blocker Mod - Start of Game Effects Overwrite
#	This effect is called from game_start.12 for empire init.
#	It does NOT get called on Void Dweller starts or Toxic Knights starts.

### Any mod that edits this scripted_effect will conflict with The Blocker Mod and will produce bugs on homeworlds.
###	Planetary Diversity edits this effect, but only to do much the same as TBM. Load TBM after Planetary Diversity or you will have bugs.
