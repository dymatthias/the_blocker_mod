### TBM Advanced Start Fixer-Upper
#	Advanced Starts wipe all blockers in game_start.20. In vanilla, this is good. in TBM, this is very very bad, and causes advanced empires do de-advance rather quickly. This effect is called from an event on_action_initialize_advanced_colony and wipes out everything above in order to re-seeds all features on those starts after everything else is done.
