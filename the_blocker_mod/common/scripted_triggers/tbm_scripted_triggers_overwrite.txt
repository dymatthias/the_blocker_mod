### The Blocker Mod - Scripted Trigger Overwrite


### Currently overwrites only this trigger, which is only used in one leader trait. The overwrite is here in case PDX ever decide to use the trigger more broadly in events.
#	TBM sets this to always evaluate true, since blockers are always clearable.
#	The only gameplay effect should be that you can roll the trait Environmental Engineer from game start.
