### The Blocker Mod - Known Issues - Version 0.3 - Alpha

1. Some aspects of certain features are disabled on homeworlds, as enabling them results in massive and cramped worlds on game start. In general, features simply won't reduce space, and vanilla "blockers" won't spawn at all. At some point in the future, a more holistic fix for this will be applied. Until then, homeworlds will get some extra bonuses, though the features can still be cleared (and will need to be to make an ecumenopolis). TBM custom features will not spawn on homeworlds at all. Most events can still affect homeworlds.

2. Numerous events are still in testing and are deliberately unregistered in on_actions until they pass testing.

3. Clearance cost and time numbers are still work-in-progress and subjject to change.

4. There is currently no support for gestalt consciousnesses. The mod's basic features will work for gestalts, but as they don't get colonists they won't get any bonuses from them. Gestalt support will be added in the future once I decide how I want to approach it.

5. Colonist modifiers are applied only when you have colonists on the planet, mostly to cut down on clutter in the feature card. Almost all features have some benefit to your colonists as they explore.

6. Terraforming will do some very interesting things to your world, and may behave unpredictably. Most of the modded features should be eligible for re-roll, but none of TBM's features are synced with terraforming events yet.

7. Currently, TBM does not affect rare features (gases, motes, crystals) at all; however, the increased number of features can sometimes result in fewer of these spawning.

8. Many planet modifiers are still work-in-progress. Most events that are implemented should have working modifiers.

9. No AI weights have been implemented yet for features, vanilla or custom. This will result in the AI bulldozing almost everything. On higher difficulties, the AI gets most of its resources from difficulty bonuses and vassals, and should be fine. On lower difficulties, it may have economic problems until the weights are implemented and the balance can be tested and tweaked.
