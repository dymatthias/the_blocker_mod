### The Blocker Mod - Known Issues - Version 0.5 - Pre-Beta

1. The Post-Apocalyptic Origin should be (close to) functional but very, very difficult as it hasn't yet been balanced. Play with caution!

2. Support for vanilla changes to Masters of Nature and the Environmentalist civic only extends to the re-specced vanilla features, pending a more thorough modding of both Masters of Nature and the way civics interact with certain features.

3. Implementation to fix features for Advanced Start empires is very preliminary. They should survive, barely, but will get a more unique, interesting set-up in future versions of the mod.
