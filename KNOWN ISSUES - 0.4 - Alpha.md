### The Blocker Mod - Known Issues - Version 0.5 - Pre-Beta

1. Numerous events are still in testing and are deliberately unregistered in on_actions until they pass testing. This is particularly the case for events on homeworld features. 0.5 is somewhat of a back-up patch, and many of these should be patched in shortly.

2. Post-Apoc and Remnant Origins have no support for gestalt consciousnesses, and the mod's colonist modifiers will not affect gestalts either, since they do not have colonists. Gestalt support will be added in the future, hopefully in the full beta.

4. Terraforming is still work-in-progress. Currently, no features are removed or swapped by terraforming. This also means there is currently no way to "restore" a planet's ecology if you've cleared a lot of it. Bulldoze with care until further notice!

5. Support for vanilla changes to Masters of Nature and the Environmentalist civic only extends to the re-specced vanilla features, pending a more thorough modding of both Masters of Nature and the way civics interact with certain features.

6. Various "event" or unique planets will lack features on spawn. This primarily affects systems added via unique solar system initializers that would normally not have blockers, such as the Sea of Consciousness, the Superflare tomb world, and the Fallen Empire colonies and Holy Worlds. A fix for this is in the works and is now mostly done but hasn't quite made it into 0.5.
