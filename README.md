The Blocker Mod

Hello, and welcome to a whole new planet!

"The Blocker Mod" is a work-in-progress mod by D. Matthias for Stellaris by Paradox Interactive. It aims to deepen the game's planetary colonization and development loop by making planetary geography both a boon and an obstacle, and by making colonists more interesting denizens of your empire.

The mod is currently in Pre-Beta. It will load and play, but many events are either partially or not yet implemented, pending further testing.
